NAME

  config.wrj - WolfMUD's default configuration file

SYNOPSIS

  DATA_DIR/config.wrj

DESCRIPTION

  config.wrj is the default configuration file looked for by the WolfMUD
  server. An alternative file can be passed to the server on the command line
  making it possible to have multiple configuration files. For example one for
  a testing configuration and one for a live configuration.

  The configuration file is a plain text file laid out using the WolfMUD
  record jar format.

FIELDS & VALUES

  Below is a list of expected fields for configuration file the and the values
  those fields expect. The field names are case insensitive.


  Server.Host: IP address | host name
    The IP address or host name identifying the network interface the server
    should listen on for incoming client connections. The default is 127.0.0.1
    for local connections only.

  Server.Port: port number | service name
    The port the server should listen on for incoming client connections. The
    port can be specified as an integer number, e.g. 4001, or as a service
    name, e.g. TELNET.

    Ports in the range 0 to 1024 are usually restricted and require special
    permissions. For example running a server on port 23 (TELNET) would
    require special permissions. The default port is 4001.

  Server.IdleTimeout: period
    The amount of time of inactivity after which the server should close an
    idle connection. The period can use a combination of hours (h), minutes
    (m) and seconds (s). The following are examples of valid values: 10s, 10m,
    1h, 1h30m. The default timeout for idle connections is 10m - 10 minutes.

  Server.MaxPlayers: count
    The maximum number of players allowed to be connected to the server at the
    same time. Count can be any integer from 0 to 4,294,967,295 although the
    number of players a server can actually support will be system specific.
    The default maximum number of players is 1024.

  Stats.Rate: period
    The period is the frequency at which statistics are collected and
    displayed by the server. The period can use a combination of hours (h),
    minutes (m) and seconds (s). The following are examples of valid values:
    10s, 10m, 1h, 1h30m. The default rate is 10s - every 10 seconds.

  Stats.GC: true | false
    This value specifies whether garbage collection should be performed just
    before server statics are collected and displayed. The default value is
    false. Note that setting this to true causes garbage collection to run at
    the same frequency as the Stats.Rate period in addition to the normal
    garbage collection.

  Inventory.Compact:
    This value causes inventories to be compacted when the difference between
    their potential capacity and actual usage is over a certain threshold.
    The threshold is calculated as:

      capacity - 2*length >= Inventory.Compact

    For the default value of 8 the excess capacity will be reclaimed when it
    is larger than twice the actual length plus 8. The default prevents
    small inventories from being constantly being reallocated. If there are
    constantly large numbers of players in many locations increasing this
    value will reduce reallocations at the expense of increased memory usage.

  Inventory.CrowdSize:
    This value determines how many players are considered to be a crowd. If
    there are more than Inventory.CrowdSize players at the same location the
    location is said to be crowded. If a location is crowded the individual
    players are not listed, instead players are informed that there is a crowd
    there. Also if a player performs an action observing players are not
    notified, but if a player is interacted with directly they will still be
    notified. The default value for Inventory.CrowdSize is 10.

  Login.AccountLength:
    This value is the minimum number of characters allowed for account IDs
    when creating new accounts. The default value is 10.

  Login.PasswordLength:
    This value is the minimum number of characters allowed for account
    passwords when creating new accounts. The default value is 10.

  Login.SaltLength:
    This value is the default length of salts generated for passwords when
    accounts are created. The default value is 32. You should not need to
    change this value.

  Debug.Panic:
    This value determines whether panics that occur in the client or event
    goroutines are allowed to terminate the server. Setting this value to true
    will cause the server to terminate, if set to false only the panicking
    goroutines will terminate. In either case a stack trace will be written to
    the log. The default value for Debug.Panic is false.

  Debug.AllowDump:
    This value determines if the #DUMP command is available to players. The
    #DUMP command should only be enabled for development and debugging as it
    can cause the server to crash when dumping objects via an address. If set
    to true the #DUMP command is available, if set to false it is not. The
    default value for Debug.AllowDump is false.

  Free text block:
    The free text block contains text that is displayed as soon as a player
    connects to the server.
