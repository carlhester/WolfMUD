  upgrading - some notes on upgrading from one release of WolfMUD to the next

DESCRIPTION

  ++ PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE UPGRADING YOUR WolfMUD SERVER. ++

  This document describes steps to take when upgrading WolfMUD to a new
  release so as not to lose player files, customised or modified zones files
  or configuration changes.

  The important directory is the data directory. For binary downloads it
  defaults to the data directory in the same folder as the server or
  server.exe binary. For source downloads or Git cloned repositories it
  defaults to: src/code.wolfmud.org/WolfMUD.git/data

  Alternatively you may have set up a custom data directory which you specify
  on the command line when the server is started.

  Wherever your data directory is located it is important to back it up or
  copy it somewhere safe. For most installations simply renaming the WolfMUD
  directory to WolfMUD.old is sufficient to back up everything.

  Once the new version of WolfMUD is installed you can delete, or rename for
  later reference, the default data directory and replace it with the backup
  or copy you made of your own data directory.

  If any files need to be upgraded, for example new settings in the
  configuration file or new fields in player or zone files, the server will
  check the files when the server is started and perform upgrades as required.
