NAME

  server - run a WolfMUD server instance

SYNOPSIS

  server [DATA_DIR][configuration_file]

DESCRIPTION

  Run a WolfMUD game server. It is strongly advised to create a separate user/
  group for running WolfMUD and that all files are owned by that user/group.
  As a security precaution player and data files should not be accessable to
  normal users on the system.

  server
    The name of the executable, on Windows substitude instances of server with
    server.exe

  DATA_DIR
    Optional relative or absolute path to the data directory. The default
    value is ./data i.e. data in the current path.

  configuration_file
    Optional name of a specific configuration file. The configuration file
    will be looked for in DATA_DIR. The default value is config.wrj

    As a special case NONE may be specified for the configuration file,
    without a DATA_DIR to load the server's default, built in configuration.
    This is only useful for testing.
