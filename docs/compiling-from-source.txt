  Compiling WolfMUD from source

DESCRIPTION

  This document describes details for compiling WolfMUD from one of the source
  code downloads.

  As a prerequisit to compiling WolfMUD you should have downloaded and
  installed Go from http://golang.org

COMPILING (LINUX)

  The following instructions assume that the WolfMUD source code download has
  been unpacked into your home directory. If a different location was used you
  should substitute ~/WolfMUD for the directory where the source code was
  unpacked.

  To compile WolfMUD for Linux first open a terminal window. Then enter the
  following:

    cd ~/WolfMUD
    GOPATH=~/WolfMUD go install ./...

RUNNING (LINUX)

  Once WolfMUD has been compiled the server executable will be in the
  directory ~/WolfMUD/bin. To run the server change to the bin directory and
  specify the location of the data files:

    cd ~/WolfMUD/bin
    ./server ../src/code.wolfmud.org/WolfMUD.git/data

COMPILING (WINDOWS)

  The following instructions assume that the WolfMUD source code download has
  been unpacked into the directory C:\WolfMUD. If a different location was
  used you should substitute C:\WolfMUD for the directory where the source
  code was unpacked.

  To compile WolfMUD for Windows first open a command prompt. This can be done
  by selecting:

    Start -> Windows System -> Command Prompt

  Alternatively press Win+R to open the run dialog. Enter cmd in the open
  field and select the OK button.

  At the command prompt enter the following:

    cd C:\WolfMUD
    set GOPATH=C:\WolfMUD
    go install ./...

RUNNING (WINDOWS)

  Once WolfMUD has been compiled the server.exe executable will be in the
  directory C:\WolfMUD\bin. To run the server change to the bin directory and
  specify the location of the data files:

    cd C:\WolfMUD\bin
    .\server.exe ..\src\code.wolfmud.org\WolfMUD.git\data
