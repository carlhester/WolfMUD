TODO list and ideas for WolfMUD-mini:

* Decide how to handle duplicate/multiple attributes for a thing.

* Veto is currently added to a specific thing. Need to be able to check for
  vetoes from other things. For example a guard could stop an item from being
  taken. Kill the guard and the item can then be taken.

* Should vetoes be made up of multiple veto instead of [][2]strings? Might make
	composition of them easier?

* Should writing have a name/description? Then we could automatically append
	'There is some writing on it.' to item descriptions unless a name/description
	is specified. In which case we could have e.g. 'There are some runes on it.'
	appended instead. This would also allow things to be written on, etched or
	inscribed by players maybe? At some point it may be interesting to add
	languages - can you actually read Elven, Dwarven or ancient mystic runes?
