// BRL or 'Big Room Lock' is responsible for all of the 'in game' locking.
// Named in tribute to the Linux kernel 'big kernel lock' that is no more. In
// Linux the BKL stopped concurrency in kernel space. In WolfMUD the BRL stops
// concurrency within a 'location'.  Unlike the BKL the BRL is not a recursive
// lock. If you need to change what you are locking, release all the locks held
// and reacquire them. Otherwise subtle and not so subtle BadThingsâ„¢ are bound
// to happen.
//
// Each BRL has a unique lock ID associated with it so that locks can be
// obtained and released in a consistent order. This is the classic resource
// hierarchy solution proposed by Dijkstra to the dining philosophers problem
// to avoid deadlocks and livelocks:
//
//  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

// locking.
