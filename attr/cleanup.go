// Cleanup implements an Attribute for disposing of Things left laying around
// in the game world. When an item is dropped it will be cleaned up after a
// delay period has elapsed. Otherwise the world would get cluttered with
// items.
//
// The delay period is between Cleanup.after and Cleanup.after+Cleanup.jitter.
// If a Thing is being cleaned up and is in its delay period the Cleanup.Cancel
// channel will be non-nil and the clean up may be aborted by closing the
// channel or by calling Cleanup.Abort which will cancel clean up requests
// recursively for a Thing.
//
// SPECIFICS
//
// If an item is put into any Inventory and the item ends up not being carried
// by a player - either in their Inventory or in a container in their Inventory
// - and the receiving inventory has no parent Inventory that are already
// scheduled for clean up then the item is scheduled for a clean up. If the
// item has an Inventory (a container) the contents do not need to be scheduled
// for clean up recursively as everything will be cleaned up when the item
// itself is cleaned up. This is also why we don't schedule a clean up when
// putting an item in an Inventory where a parent Inventory is scheduled for a
// clean up already.
//
// If an item is removed from any Inventory any pending clean ups are
// cancelled. If the item has an Inventory its content - checked recursively -
// will have any pending clean ups cancelled. If we don't cancel pending clean
// ups recursively then putting an item into a container and then picking the
// container up would result in the item still being scheduled for a clean up,
// resulting in the item disappearing from the container.
