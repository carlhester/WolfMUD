v0.0.3 Released Friday 23rd December, 2016
==============================================================================

Fixed

	- Colour bleeding issues fixed (Mainly Windows TELNET)
	- Multiple description sequence fixed so that main descriptions come first.


v0.0.2 Released Monday 5th December, 2016
==============================================================================

Added

	- Text folding now has support for Unicode combining characters.
	- Added NONE as a runtime option to not load any configuration file.
		See docs/running-the-server.txt for details.
	- New messages package containing message buffers.
	- Message buffers now support a silent mode.
	- Commands now send coloured messages:
			- Red: Something bad / undesirable happened
			- Green: Something good / desirable happened
			- Yellow: Something informational happened
	- Server greeting can now contain embeded colour codes.
	- Added initial tests for text and message packages.
	- New docs/upgrading.txt

Changed

	- Improved performance of embedded colour codes.
	- text.Dictionary map now protected by sync.Mutex.
	- Message buffers moved from cmd/state to new message package.
	- Message buffers reimplemented, no longer based on bytes.Buffer.
	- Message buffers now use Send and Append methods instead of WriteJoin.
	- cmd/state and frontend both use new message package for buffers.
	- state.script method uses new message buffers.

Fixed

	- Fixed an issue with TELNET clients sending unprocessed strings containing
		DEL (ASCII 0x7F or \b) characters. Using delete in Windows TELNET client
		now works as expected.
	- Text folding should only preserve leading whitespace.
	- Fixed a panic in text.Fold with a width less than 1.
	- Fixed a panic if player only enters stop words.

Known bugs

	- An extra blank line is sometimes appended to the end of the greeting
		displayed when players connect. This seems to be an issue in the recordjar
		package.
	- If Send or Append is used to start a message and only a colour is written a
		subsequent Append will cause a space to be present at the start of the
		message.

Security

	- None :)


v0.0.1 Released Monday 31st October, 2016
