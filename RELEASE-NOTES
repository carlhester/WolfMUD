v0.0.4 Released Thursday 2nd March, 2017
==============================================================================

Added

  - Test cases added for rewritten recordjar.Read method.
  - New recordjar data types: StringList, KeyedString, KeyedStringList. See
    docs/zone-files.txt for details.
  - Zone files can now contain vetoes.
  - cmd.state has a new Script method for scripting commands. Commands only
    usable in scripting mode denoted by prefixing the command with a '$'
    symbol.
  - New script only $POOF command to announce players joining game.
  - attr.Inventory gained a Narratives method to retrieve narrative items.
  - new event package for asynchronous scripted commands.
  - text package gained a new TitleFirst method to uppercase the dirst rune in
    a string.
  - All attributes and attr.Thing now have a Copy method. The Copy method has
    also been added to the has.Attribute and has.Thing interfaces.
  - New Door attribute added so that doors can be defined in zone files. See
    docs/zone-files.txt for details.
  - Added the tavern door and shed door to data/zones/zinara.wrj as example
    doors.
  - New OPEN and CLOSE commands to open and close doors.

Changed

  - Rewritten recordjar.Read method to be simpler and have fewer corner cases.
  - EXAMINE command can now be vetoed.
  - zones package now adds a Locate attribute to Things with a Door attribute.
  - zones package now creates the 'other side' of doors when a Thing has a Door
    attribute.
  - Update COMMANDS command to not report scripting only commands starting with
    a '$' symbol.
  - MOVE command can now be vetoed.

Fixed

  - Another colour bleeding issue fixed.
  - Nil panic fixed when loading zones and populating inventories with an
    invalid ref.
  - Passing of a copied mutex in text.Dictionary.
  - recordjar.decoder should uppercase returned key and data as documented.
  - attr.inventory Add method should always call SetWhere if Locate attribute
    is found.

Known bugs

  - Adding a Door attribute to a non-narrative, e.g. directly to a location or
    a moveable item, can result in strange and unexpected behaviour.
  - The new Thing and Attribute copy mechanism does not check for cyclic
    dependencies.

v0.0.3 Released Friday 23rd December, 2016
==============================================================================

Fixed

  - Colour bleeding issues fixed (Mainly Windows TELNET)
  - Multiple description sequence fixed so that main descriptions come first.


v0.0.2 Released Monday 5th December, 2016
==============================================================================

Added

  - Text folding now has support for Unicode combining characters.
  - Added NONE as a runtime option to not load any configuration file.
    See docs/running-the-server.txt for details.
  - New messages package containing message buffers.
  - Message buffers now support a silent mode.
  - Commands now send coloured messages:
      - Red: Something bad / undesirable happened
      - Green: Something good / desirable happened
      - Yellow: Something informational happened
  - Server greeting can now contain embeded colour codes.
  - Added initial tests for text and message packages.
  - New docs/upgrading.txt

Changed

  - Improved performance of embedded colour codes.
  - text.Dictionary map now protected by sync.Mutex.
  - Message buffers moved from cmd/state to new message package.
  - Message buffers reimplemented, no longer based on bytes.Buffer.
  - Message buffers now use Send and Append methods instead of WriteJoin.
  - cmd/state and frontend both use new message package for buffers.
  - state.script method uses new message buffers.

Fixed

  - Fixed an issue with TELNET clients sending unprocessed strings containing
    DEL (ASCII 0x7F or \b) characters. Using delete in Windows TELNET client
    now works as expected.
  - Text folding should only preserve leading whitespace.
  - Fixed a panic in text.Fold with a width less than 1.
  - Fixed a panic if player only enters stop words.

Known bugs

  - An extra blank line is sometimes appended to the end of the greeting
    displayed when players connect. This seems to be an issue in the recordjar
    package.
  - If Send or Append is used to start a message and only a colour is written a
    subsequent Append will cause a space to be present at the start of the
    message.

Security

  - None :)
